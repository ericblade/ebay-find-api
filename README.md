# ebay-find-api

Simple wrapper for 'ebay' module, mostly to give it a far less generic name, since all it does
is implement part of the 'finding' part of the eBay API.

Also sanitizing the output into something that makes a little more sense -- you don't need arrays
for everything.

Note that I'm only implementing functions as I need them, so if you need something that isn't
here, feel free to request it, or implement it and send a pull request.

Thanks!
Have a great day!
